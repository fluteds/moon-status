# Moon Phase Status

Automatically changes your Discord status to an emoji showing what phase of the moon it's currently in.

## Will I get banned?

Maybe. This is classified as a self bot because of the status changing and goes against Discord's TOS but I haven't seen users actively get banned for status changing so use at your own risk on an account you don't that much care for. I used a disposable alt account for testing.

You will need:

- OpenWeatherMap Key.
- Discord User Token.
- A lot of patience because moon phases are not speedy nor animated so this script can be run once a day or every other day, whatever suits you.

## Disclaimer

I am not responsible for any token losses from your own practices. This script does not store any of your information outside of the config. You should be keeping your tokens safe just like bank card details. If you cannot work out how to use this script from the config and don't know how to get your own Discord token, this is not for you.
